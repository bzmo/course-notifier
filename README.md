# course-notifier

Using Python, course-notifier notifies you when a class is open by e-mail by querying http://www.adm.uwaterloo.ca/.


<b> To Start </b>

Fill in the 'Email' and 'Course Selection' constants in 'query.py' with the appropriate info and then run it.

Preferably, use a crontab job to run 'query.py' periodically.
